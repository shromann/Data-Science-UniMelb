# Complex Decisions      
## Mechanism Design
- The problem of how to design a "game" that maximizes a global utility function in a multi-agent system, given each agent goes for their own strategy

-  In AI, the aim is to make smart systems out of simpler systems to do things beyond simple single system. 

- This subject only deals with **Auctions**

## Auctions 
### Considerations & Motivation
   1. **Bidder**: *Maximizing Price*
      - Maximum budget
      - How much do I even value it?
   2. **Auctioneer**: *Maximizing Price*
      - Fake bidding to push the price





###  Mechanism Design Problems
1. **Single Item Auctions**
2. **Combinatorial Auctions**
3. **Public Projects**
